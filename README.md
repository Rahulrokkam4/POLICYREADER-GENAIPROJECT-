# POLICYREADER-GENAIPROJECT-
Policy Reader is an intelligent, interactive question-answering app built using LangChain, Groqâ€™s LLaMA3-70B, and FAISS. It allows users to input a URL (e.g., a government policy or legal document), processes the content, and enables natural language querying over the document using advanced LLM reasoning.
